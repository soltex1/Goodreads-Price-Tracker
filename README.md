# Goodreads Price Tracker (backend)


:orange_book: This is a price tracker for your books listed on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) as `want-to-read`.

:convenience_store: Stores available:

* [Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/)
* [Wook](https://www.wook.pt/) 
* [Bertrand](https://www.bertrand.pt/) 
* [Fnac](https://www.fnac.pt/)

### Description

I am an active user on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/), who is always updating my current readings and also adding new books to my `want-to-read` list. Most of the times when I want to buy a book, I go through my list, pick a book, and then I go check on some shops if there is a good price. So, I decided to create this application to automate the process.

### Composition

This application is divided in two parts:

* [Backend](https://github.com/soltex1/goodreads-price-tracker-backend) **Node**
* [Frontend](https://github.com/soltex1/goodreads-price-tracker-frontend) **React**

The project already has the latest version of the frontend compiled. However, you can also access the source code repostory through the link above.


### How It Works
